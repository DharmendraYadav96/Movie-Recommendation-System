## Introduction

This is a Movie Recommendation System implemented using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The system provides movie recommendations based on user preferences and similarities between users' movie-watching histories.

## Dataset
In the given dataset, we are given a lot of information about a particular movie. We need to restrict ourselves to the columns, Movie ID, Movie Name, IMDB Rating and binary indicators of different genres.

## Features

- User-based collaborative filtering for movie recommendations.
- Efficient k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for finding similar users.
- A user-friendly interface for inputting user preferences.
- Recommendations based on user's ratings and movie similarities.
- Planned: Support for additional recommendation methods, such as matrix factorization and content-based filtering.
